# Blinky to Bootloader

Welcome to the **Blinky to Bootloader** repository! This project is dedicated to exploring the STM32F401 microcontroller from the basics all the way to a fully functional bootloader that includes an update mechanism. We focus on bare metal programming without the use of any IDE, allowing you to gain a deeper understanding of embedded systems.

In this repository, you will find simple examples starting with the classic "Blinky" program. As you progress, you'll learn how to implement UART communication, and eventually, develop a bootloader capable of firmware updates. Each code example is well-documented to ensure you can follow along easily and grasp the low-level interaction with the hardware.

Clone the repository, set up your toolchain, and start coding! This project is designed for anyone looking to enhance their skills in embedded programming, whether you're a beginner or an experienced engineer.
